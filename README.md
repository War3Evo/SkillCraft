SkillCraft - What makes a great Race?  That is for you to decide!


INTRODUCTION:


I feel that SkillCraft would be more for a competition server, and WarCraft is focused on a fun server.   Warcraft and SkillCraft are two different flavors of the same soda, yet you will find many similarities with them. :P

WarCraft is for those whom want to have fun, level up, buy shopmenu items and stuff.   WarCraft is for the players whom want to say "Ha! I am a higher level than you!"   WarCraft is for those whom wish to achieve higher levels and grab new ground by working hard to gain xp.   For those whom take a sit in WarCraft and stay for the long hall will earn their place above everyone else.   There are many Races to choose from, and it boils down to your know how.  If you know how the Race works, then you'll be able to wipe out your foe better.   Learn about all the Races, experience new levels.   The most fun part of WarCraft is leveling.   I personally love to switch from Race to Race, just to experience the leveling experience.

SkillCraft is not for everyone.   If you want a God vs God experience, where its your wit verse the other persons wit, then your in for a ride of your life.   SkillCraft isn't for the weak of heart.   SkillCraft is meant to carry the most OP skills and have you battle for your life!   So don't go complaining to me that a Skill in SkillCraft is OP!   Everyone has access to all the skills, unless a server operator sets that skill VIP, given to them for a truly competition style game.  You have 4 skill types that you can pick from.  Out of these Skill types you will gain a list to the most popular WarCraft Skills and then some...

So, what makes a Race in SkillCraft?   That is for you to decide.


Playing for fun and playing for competition is two different play styles and requires two different game environments.    Many players whom come to our WarCraft servers looking for competition and increasing their KDR like crazy will find it not so fun.   We have a KDR system on our WarCraft servers in order to keep the playstyle of fun in place.   WarCraft isn't meant to be a competition server and is the reason we are creating SkillCraft.


So, my question is... Do you play for fun or for competition?


The goal of SkillCraft is to allow players more flexibility in the creation of their Race.   If they ask what Race is best?   You reply with, "That is for you to decide" and maybe also "You create your Race from the skills you pick"



SkillCraft also allows players to copy other players skills from the playerinfo menu.

SkillCraft has a cooldown HUD that can be turned on from the "prefs" menu system.

SkillCraft's orignal concept was to create a freeform Warcraft where everyone is on the same level with access to the same skills.  No Races, No leveling, No currency.   We are currently looking into creating maybe a point system so that players can rank against each other in this competitive version of WarCraft.




Structure
=========

Lets keep all the function naming system the same.   War3Source has a problem where they have multiple naming structures.  ie.  W3, OnWar3, and War3_.   For SkillCraft we only have either SC_ or On_SC_.

* Rename stuff so that other source coders do not have to figure out what it is without having to go thru all the sourcecode.

* Tabs only.  No spaces.   All spaces will be converted to Tabs.
