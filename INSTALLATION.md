Installation
============

Installation is pretty much the same as War3Source.

The only current difference, is instead of war3source.cfg, 
you'll need to use skillcraft.cfg.

As of the current version, we are still using the same naming system
for some of the files from War3Source so that you do not have
to use double the space on your hard drive.

So, you will still keep war3source.ini, and skillcraft will read
from that file in order to determine the database to use.

As of right now, the XP system isn't even looked at via the
war3source.ini.
